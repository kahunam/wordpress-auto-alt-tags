**Audit Date:** 2025-09-08  
**Auditor:** Security Analysis System  

## Executive Summary

The Auto Alt Tag Generator plugin has been thoroughly audited for security vulnerabilities and WordPress coding standards compliance. The plugin demonstrates **excellent security practices** with no critical or high-severity vulnerabilities identified.

## Security Assessment Results

### ✅ SQL Injection Protection
**Status:** SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (No vulnerabilities found)  

All database queries properly use WordPress's `$wpdb->prepare()` method:
- `auto-alt-tags.php:1133, 1143, 1176` - Statistics queries use prepared statements
- `auto-alt-tags.php:1882-1883` - Cleanup queries with LIKE patterns are safe
- `includes/class-wp-cli-command.php:199, 209, 329, 359` - All CLI queries use prepared statements

### ✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection
**Status:** SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (No vulnerabilities found)  

All output is properly escaped:
- HTML output uses `esc_html()` and `esc_html__()` consistently
- Attributes use `esc_attr()` for safe rendering
- Text areas use `esc_textarea()` appropriately
- Translatable strings use proper escaping functions

### ✅ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
**Status:** SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (No vulnerabilities found)  

Comprehensive CSRF protection implemented:
- Nonce creation: `auto-alt-tags.php:216` with `wp_create_nonce('auto_alt_nonce')`
- All AJAX endpoints verify nonces with `check_ajax_referer()`:
  - `ajax_test_api_connection()` - Line 639
  - `ajax_test_provider_key()` - Line 673
  - `ajax_process_alt_tags()` - Line 978
  - `ajax_get_image_stats()` - Line 1111
  - `ajax_test_first_five()` - Line 1667

### ✅ Data Sanitization
**Status:** SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (No vulnerabilities found)  

All user inputs are properly sanitized:
- POST data sanitized with `sanitize_text_field()` (Lines 649, 650, 682, 683)
- API keys and sensitive data sanitized before storage
- File paths and URLs properly validated

### ✅ Authorization & Access Control
**Status:** SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (No vulnerabilities found)  

Proper capability checks throughout:
- Admin page access requires `manage_options` capability (Line 293)
- All AJAX handlers verify `manage_options` capability:
  - Lines 644, 678, 983, 1116, 1672
- Menu registration uses appropriate capability (Line 282)

### ✅ File Operations Security
**Status:** SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (No vulnerabilities found)  

- Plugin uses WordPress attachment system exclusively
- No direct file system operations outside WordPress APIs
- Image handling through WordPress media functions only

## WordPress Coding Standards Compliance

### ✅ Code Organization
- **Single-class architecture** for main functionality
- **Proper separation** of CLI commands in separate class
- **Clean file structure** with assets properly organized

### ✅ WordPress Best Practices
